* Test Suite

This is the test suite for crucible. To run the tests, the [[https://github.com/malloc-nbytes/earl][EARL language]] must be installed.

There are two different directories, namely:
- old [uses EARL to run the tests]
- bootstrap [uses crucible to run the tests]

To run both of the tests, simply run:

#+begin_src
  /bin/bash run.sh
#+end_src

and it will run both test suites.

** old
Begin the tests by doing:

#+begin_src
  cd old
  earl runner.rl
#+end_src

** bootstrap
Begin the tests by doing:

#+begin_src
  cd bootstrap
  /bin/bash run.sh
#+end_src

See =earl runner.rl -- help= for more options.
