# crucible

A compiled programming that I am making on stream.

Visit at: https://www.twitch.tv/malloc_nbytes

# Requirements

I am currently using a library for basic data structures/string functionality
and this will be removed once this compiler is bootstrapped. It requires `forge` [https://github.com/malloc-nbytes/forge].

# Compilation

```
./autogen.sh
./configure
make
```
